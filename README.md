# Interrupt_Display
This program starts at a flashing light stage that flashes all 8 LEDS at a frequency of 5Hz. Then, when the button is pressed, it will signal the interrupt to cease the code and go into the interrupt handler. It will print out a randomly generated number and decrement it by 10 until the value is less or equal to 0 and reset to flashing stage.
